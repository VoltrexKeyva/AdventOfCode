# AdventOfCode

This repository holds the archives of my journey through the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) year by year.

### Extra notes

For building C source(s) here, build it with `make <number>`. The number corresponds with the source file name order, e.g: `solve-puzzle-<number>.c`. The executable would be called `solved`.
